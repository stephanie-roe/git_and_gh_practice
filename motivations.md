A huge motivation to embark on this exciting career change is the desire for challenge. In my current and previous roles, I have been successful and have developed many skills for which I am grateful, but I've found myself in a circumstance where I have mastered my role and have limited options for upward mobility as I do not have a college degree. Working in the retail and hospitality industries, time is the most important credential and an individual's capabilities are often overlooked if a candidate is younger. That said, I am excited to show up for myself and honor my desire to seek a more challenging, mentally-stimulating and fulfilling. Not working and committing to the student life is a bold decision which a year ago I never would have seen myself making. I'm excited to take control of my future and actively advocate for myself and my future.
