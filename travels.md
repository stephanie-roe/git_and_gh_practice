My favorite travel experience happened in 2018. Growing up, my family could not afford travel, so this was the first vacation I took myself on as an adult. My best friend and I went to visit her family in L.A. for a week and she showed me around the city and introduced me to her friends there. It was a really special experience and taught me the importance of travel, exploration and balancing work with well-deserved leisure time.
