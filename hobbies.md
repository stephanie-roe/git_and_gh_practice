There are several hobbies which I enjoy, cooking, sewing and my houseplants are just a few of my favorites.

I've always enjoyed cooking, even from a very young age. Currently, I meal prep a lot to simplify my busy lifestyle, but I do occasionally indulge in an afternoon of cooking a complex meal for my partner and I to enjoy.

Sewing is a new hobby I've picked up. I mainly like to rework vintage garments I find at the thrift store to give them a touch of my personal style. Currently, I am learning how to do my own alterations.

I have a love-hate relationship with my houseplants. At the moment, they are all doing well but typically in the winter they struggle to get enough sunlight.
